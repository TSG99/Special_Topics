# Special_Topics
This is my Final Project for Special Topics in Natural Language Processing
It looks into how the size of a semantic cluster affects the number of words that can be retrieved from said cluster. The data used was the Small World of Words (SWOW-EN) dataset.
While I cannot directly share the data here it can be found here: https://smallworldofwords.org/en/project/research
Also, it is encouraged to participate in the study: https://smallworldofwords.org/en
It is quick (~5min) and helps make contributions to the dataset
